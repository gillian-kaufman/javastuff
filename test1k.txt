The obvious search algorithm considers each character position of string and determines whether the successive patlen characters of string starting at that position match the successive patlen characters of pat. Knuth, Morris, and Pratt have observed that this algorithm is quadratic. That is, in the worst case, the number of comparisons is on the order of i * patlen. Knuth, Morris, and Pratt have described a linear search algorithm which preprocesses pat in time linear in patlen and then searches string in time linear in i + patlen. Their algorithm inspects each of the first i + patlen - 1 characters of string precisely once. We now present a search algorithm which is usually "sublinear": It may not inspect each of the first i + patlen - 1 characters of string. By "usually sublinear" we mean that the expected value of the number of inspected characters in string is c * (i + patlen), where c < 1 and gets smaller as patlen increases. there are patterns and strings for which worse behavior is exhibited. However, Knuth has shown that the algorithm is linear even in the worst case.
